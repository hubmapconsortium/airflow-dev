# airflow-dev

Configuration, workflows, and DAGs for the development instance of Airflow on HIVE infrastructure.

If you have a workflow you'd like to run as data is submitted to HuBMAP, make a PR here and then ...? 

The details of most workflows will be in docker containers.
For workflows which take intermediate formats and translate them into formats
for visualization on the web, see the [`portal-containers`](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-containers) repo.
